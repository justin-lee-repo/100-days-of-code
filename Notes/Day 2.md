# Day 2

## Learning Python

- Terms for the Language
  - Terms
    - These are the different types of words
  - Data Types
    - What pieces of data can the programming language hold
    - Different Data Types that the language can hold
  - Actions
    - Tell our machines to store data and retreive data to perform some action for it
  - Best Practices
    - Good ways of writing Python code, and then there are bad ways

## Fundamental Data Types

- You can check the data type like thi:
  ```Python
  print(type(6)) will get an integer
  print(type(2 / 4)) will get a float
  ```
  - This will output class 'int'
  - int
    - all numbers
    - 3, 4, 5
    - You can use this in mathematical operations
    ```Python
    print(2 + 4)
    print(2 * 4)
    print(2 / 4) this will be a float which isnt an integer
    ```
  - float
    - Number with a decimal point
  - bool
  - str
    - All letters
  - list
  - tuple
  - set
  - dict

## Classes

- We can create or own data types
- Custom types

## Specialized Data Types

- Modules
  - Extensions that you can add in the language

## None

- this means nothing, kinda like 'null'

## Mathmatical Operations

- Similar to JS in the way you can do the following:
  ```Python
  print(2 + 4)
  print(2 * 4)
  print(2 / 4)
  print(2 - 4)
  ```
- You can
