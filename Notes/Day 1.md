### What is a Programming Language

- Langages can be a higher level that is closer to human language. Or lower level, which is much closer to machine code like Assembly

- Interpreter vs. Compiler
  - In order for the computer to understand the source code, we need a translator. Which is caled a Interpreter or a compiler. Python usually uses a interpreter. This goes line by line and executes to the computer
  - Compilers takes the code, reads it all at once and translates.

### Python Interpreter

- Downloading Python
  - python.org
- Programming Language
  - Most languages operate on the same principles, it typically gets easier after learning the first foundational language
  - Python downloaded from the site is written in C, Jython is a different translator that is in Java. Pypy is a interpreter written in Python.
- Cpython
  - Prints stuff out using Bytecode which is close to machine code
  - Uses Cpython VM to run the bytecode to use on the machine

### tools to use

- Terminal
- Code Editor - Visual Code
  -IDEs - Pycharm or spyder
- Notebooks - Jupiter Notebooks
  -repl.it - This allows us to write Python w/o downloading all the tools above, just an all-in-one
  -glot.io - Open sourced free that works the same

### Our first Python Program

- Print our own name
  `print('Justin Lee')`

- Input and storing a variable
  `name = input('What is your name?')

print('helloooooo ' + name)`
