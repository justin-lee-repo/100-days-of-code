# Day 3

## Operator Precedence

- Similar to how it would look like in Math class
  - 20 + 12 \* 3 = 48
- This works the same in all programming languages
- The order
  - Parenthesis
  - Power of \*\*
  - Multiplication/Divison
  - Addition/Subtraction

## bin() and complex

- Data Type: Complex
  - A number that is a third type instead of int and float
  - real + imag(num)
  - This isn't really used much apart from really complex math quesions
- Bin()
  - Returns the binary composition of an integer
  - bin(5) would be 0b101
    - 0b is to tell you that this does not exist
  - You can also do int('0b101', 2)
    - You are telling it to be base 2 because binary is base 2. So it'll take the value and the base it's in to convert to integer

## Variables

- A way to store information
- Assigning a value to a variable is called binding
