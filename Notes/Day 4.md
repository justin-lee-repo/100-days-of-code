# Day 4

## Variables (cont.)

- Best practices
  - snake_case
    - Start with lowercase or underscore
    - Letters, numbers, underscores
    - Case sensitive
    - Don't overwrite keywords. These are reserved keywords, they're highlighted in Blue in certain IDEs
  - Variables should be really descriptively
  - Variables an be re-assigned
- Gotchas
  - Constants
    - Things that never change in the program
    - Example of this is like PI which is a standardized variable that won't change
    - These are typically all capitalized, which means it should never be changed
  - Double Underscores
    - 'Dunder'
    - These are meant to be left alone, so don't create variables without dunders
- Rapidly assign variables
  - a,b,c - 1,2,3
  - This allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time, shorthand

## Expressions vs. Statements

- Expression is a piece of code that produces a value
  - ip / 5 = expression
- Statement is an entire line of code
  - user_age = iq / 5
