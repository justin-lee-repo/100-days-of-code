# Welcome to my 100 days of code!

---

I'll be docuemnting my journey here of my path in learning Python and React. I've chosen to do two courses simultaneously mainly because I find that I lose focus when I'm doing a single thing consistently. I'm hoping by having two courses I can bounce around I can maintaim my focus.

Here are some of the resources that I'll be using: [Resources](#resources)

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Markdown
  - Interpreter vs. Compiler
  - Repl.it
  - Python 2 vs 3
- Time: 90 minutes

### Today's Topic(s)

Big thing today was learning the Markdown syntax so I can start writing these updates. I haven't really used Markdown extensively before so having this pretty easy to use language is a great way to take notes and make it look great. The other side benefit here is that I can practice reading documentation. These always seems so daunting, I've tried reading CSS library documentation and it was a tough one.

Other than that, we really just covered the basics today in terms of what Python is and at a high level (no pun intended) how Python gets interpreted into machine code and the differences between interpreters and compilers.

Got an introduction to repl.it which just looks like a playground for people to quickly test out their code. And finally, Python 3 that came out in 2008 is still 'newish' and that some code bases are still written in Python 2.

### Journal

I'm going to use this section to documenthow I feel and improvements that I want ot make to this repo. The majority of my inspiration came from my awesome co-worker Connor, so cheers to him and make sure to follow him on Twitter: [@connorrobots](https://twitter.com/connorrobots).

It seems daunting to have to recap everything everyday, but i know this is how I'll grow and I expect these recaps to be shorter in the future.... or maybe even longer who knows!

One thing that might help though is the possibility of using a text expander like Typinator or Alfred to very quickly dish out Markdown syntax like the one to write Python script. I'm going to work on that in Day 2.

# Tools

### Classes

- [Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/) Quick tip, if you haven't been on Udemy before, all of their classes are routinely on sale for \$10, I wouldn't recommend buying full price!

- [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) Same thing, also always on sale for about \$10

### Applications

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my text editor, I'll post my extensions list at a later point

- [Zappy by Zapier](https://zapier.com/zappy) Screenshot capture for MacOS only.

- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) Tbh, I haven't really explored the full functionality of this yet the tabs are cool, but I don't feel advanced enough yet to understand why this is better than the normal MacOS native terminal.
