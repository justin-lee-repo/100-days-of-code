# Welcome to my 100 days of code!

---

I'll be docuemnting my journey here of my path in learning Python and React. I've chosen to do two courses simultaneously mainly because I find that I lose focus when I'm doing a single thing consistently. I'm hoping by having two courses I can bounce around I can maintaim my focus.

Here are some of the resources that I'll be using: [Resources](#tools)

## Day # 10:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Conditional Statements
  - Turnary Operator
- Time: 60

### Today's Topic(s)

Did a lot of if/else statements or conditional statements today. Learned some more operators as well. I really like how this class is structured, when I learned JS, it was throwing all the operators at you at once, without much context on how to use it. By combining the operators as well as conditional statements together, I get more context as to how these are used.

### Journal

No roadblocks today, made a decent dent into this class. The next few sections should involved a lot more searching and researching so I think this will be good practice. Also tried to make the markdown tables above look prettier, but my formatter extension in VScode is making me put in all of the hyphens, so please excuse the disorganization in my raw code.

## Day #9:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Tuples
  - Sets
- Time: 30

### Today's Topic(s)

Tuples and Sets were pretty easy to follow here, I think these are more advanced functionaly compared to JS. Tuples are interesting in that these seem like really fixed. Definately would love to see how we use it in our code base.

### Journal

No roadblocks, getting a lot more familiar with methods vs function. This also completed the first portion of the Python basics course now since we've finished all the data types and structures. Moving onto functions next. WOO!!

## Day #8:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Dictionary
  - Dictionary Methods
- Time: 30

### Today's Topic(s)

Went over dictionaries today, I'm guessing i'll be using these the most though since these are what a lot of JSON objects will come in. But this was pretty fun to learn in general and there are a lot of great features compared to JS.

### Journal

No roadblocks here today, getting a bit more familar with functions vs methods. Plus, we're also going to be learning functions a lot more next. I guess one questions is why do you make something like len() a function vs method. I guess it's because you're creating a new variable to get the length and not modifying the existing variable.

## Day # 7:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Lists
  - List Methods
  - Password Challenge
- Time: 60

### Today's Topic(s)

We went over mainly lists and list methods today. Pretty simple. they're ordered, they're in the same memory space. Also did a password checker today, that was pretty easy to do and did a great job with variables too!

### Journal

Going to use this space for roadblocks too. Main roadblocks is that I always get confused with functions vs methods. For example, there is a len function here where you can do len(my_list) which gives you a length. However, there are other methods like .pop and stuff, and someties I get confused. I think just something I need to keep an eye on.

## Day #6:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Immutability
  - Commenting
  - Methods and functions
  - Booleons
- Time: 40

### Today's Topic(s)

Another great day of topics, again great to see similarities between Python and Javascript. The commenting video on when to make comments was also interesting as it's not a good practice to just write too many comments.

Booleons and Methods/Functions were pretty easy to understand

### Journal

Nothing new for today, just glad to be able to hit a milestone today which is 2/3 done with this chapter. A few more videos until I've learned all the basics!

## Day #5:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Strings
  - Escape sequences
  - String Index
- Time: 60 min

### Today's Topic(s)

Made some great progress today and while familiar withe these concepts, there are definately awesome features Python has in handling these. Specifically, string concatenation is pretty easy to do and reminds me a lot of JSX in React.

String index going into negative is awesome, nifty little trick that you can use to reverse a string which I've found is a popular test they like to do in interviews. Though I assume they'd probably ask you multiple ways to reverse strings and not just the copy out method that Pythong provides haha.

### Journal

I realized I need to cut these a bit shorter, as excited as I am to write about what I learn, it's not sustainable to spend 20 minutes on writing these summaries everyday when I could be working on more code.

## Day #4:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Variables
  - Rapidly assigning variables
- Time: 20 min

### Today's Topic(s)

Pretty basic knowledge of variables, knowing this from JS this wasn't too new. Really like how you can rapidly assign variables in Python, 1,b,c = 1,2,3. I don't believe this is a feature in JS. Also great to see Dunders here, i saw this a lot in the code base at another company so never knew what this was

### Journal

- Short day today, great snippets of information here

## Day #3:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Data Types
    - Bin
    - Complex
    - Variables
- Time: 25

### Today's Topic(s)

Pretty simple today, just bin and complex, they were pretty easy to understand and follow. I think Bin can be a useful feature, already thinking about how in the broader context, how these number data types can help with converting different values to one another when connecting APIs and what not.

Complex was also cool to learn as we can see why Python is loved by the Math community. Excited to see in future topics how we can use Python in Math and Science applications

### Journal

Don't really have any updates. This was a short sprint today, going to focus more on variables in the next days.

## Day #2:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Data Types
    - Integers
    - Floats
  - Mathmatical Operations
    - \*\* = power of
    - // = nearest integer
    - % = remainder
- Time: 45 minutes

### Today's Topic(s)

Going through the basics has really reinforced concepts when learning JS. I'm starting to grasp the foundational elements of code. This section has been laregely review, but there were some data types that I wasn't too familiar with such as dict or tuble. Really eager to see what the differences are between them.

I hope declaring variables within scope won't be as tough as in JS haha.

Math basics were pretty easy to understand honestly, but some of the mathmatical operations were pretty cool to see in action.

### Journal

Feeling pretty good so far. Nothing has been too tough for me so far. Eager to dive right in to learn more about functions already but I awknowledge there are enough differences between JS and Python syntax that I feel like I really need to make sure I don't overlook these things.

Also, given how busy life is these days, I don't think this will be 100 consecutive days of code. Really, this will be 100 days of non-consecutive code.

## Day #1:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Markdown
  - Interpreter vs. Compiler
  - Repl.it
  - Python 2 vs 3
- Time: 90 minutes

### Today's Topic(s)

Big thing today was learning the Markdown syntax so I can start writing these updates. I haven't really used Markdown extensively before so having this pretty easy to use language is a great way to take notes and make it look great. The other side benefit here is that I can practice reading documentation. These always seems so daunting, I've tried reading CSS library documentation and it was a tough one.

Other than that, we really just covered the basics today in terms of what Python is and at a high level (no pun intended) how Python gets interpreted into machine code and the differences between interpreters and compilers.

Got an introduction to repl.it which just looks like a playground for people to quickly test out their code. And finally, Python 3 that came out in 2008 is still 'newish' and that some code bases are still written in Python 2.

### Journal

I'm going to use this section to documenthow I feel and improvements that I want ot make to this repo. The majority of my inspiration came from my awesome co-worker Connor, so cheers to him and make sure to follow him on Twitter: [@connorrobots](https://twitter.com/connorrobots).

It seems daunting to have to recap everything everyday, but i know this is how I'll grow and I expect these recaps to be shorter in the future.... or maybe even longer who knows!

One thing that might help though is the possibility of using a text expander like Typinator or Alfred to very quickly dish out Markdown syntax like the one to write Python script. I'm going to work on that in Day 2.

### Classes

- [Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/) Quick tip, if you haven't been on Udemy before, all of their classes are routinely on sale for \$10, I wouldn't recommend buying full price!

- [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) Same thing, also always on sale for about \$10

### Applications

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my text editor, I'll post my extensions list at a later point

- [Zappy by Zapier](https://zapier.com/zappy) Screenshot capture for MacOS only.

- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) Tbh, I haven't really explored the full functionality of this yet the tabs are cool, but I don't feel advanced enough yet to understand why this is better than the normal MacOS native terminal.
