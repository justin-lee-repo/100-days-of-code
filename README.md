# Welcome to my 100 days of code!

---

I'll be docuemnting my journey here of my path in learning Python and React. I've chosen to do two courses simultaneously mainly because I find that I lose focus when I'm doing a single thing consistently. I'm hoping by having two courses I can bounce around I can maintaim my focus.

Here are some of the resources that I'll be using: [Resources](#tools)

### Week 1

| Day 1                                                                                                     | Day 2                                       | Day 3                                       | Day 4 | Day 5 | Day 6 | Day 7 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [The Basics, Markdown, How does Python work as a high level language, interpreters vs. compilers](#day-1) | [Int, float, math operations basic](#day-2) | [Operator Precednece, bin, complex](#day-3) | ...   | ...   | ...   | ...   |

## Day #3:

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Data Types
    - Bin
    - Complex
    - Variables
- Time: 25

### Today's Topic(s)

Pretty simple today, just bin and complex, they were pretty easy to understand and follow. I think Bin can be a useful feature, already thinking about how in the broader context, how these number data types can help with converting different values to one another when connecting APIs and what not.

Complex was also cool to learn as we can see why Python is loved by the Math community. Excited to see in future topics how we can use Python in Math and Science applications

### Journal

Don't really have any updates. This was a short sprint today, going to focus more on variables in the next days.

## Day #2:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Data Types
    - Integers
    - Floats
  - Mathmatical Operations
    - \*\* = power of
    - // = nearest integer
    - % = remainder
- Time: 45 minutes

### Today's Topic(s)

Going through the basics has really reinforced concepts when learning JS. I'm starting to grasp the foundational elements of code. This section has been laregely review, but there were some data types that I wasn't too familiar with such as dict or tuble. Really eager to see what the differences are between them.

I hope declaring variables within scope won't be as tough as in JS haha.

Math basics were pretty easy to understand honestly, but some of the mathmatical operations were pretty cool to see in action.

### Journal

Feeling pretty good so far. Nothing has been too tough for me so far. Eager to dive right in to learn more about functions already but I awknowledge there are enough differences between JS and Python syntax that I feel like I really need to make sure I don't overlook these things.

Also, given how busy life is these days, I don't think this will be 100 consecutive days of code. Really, this will be 100 days of non-consecutive code.

## Day #1:

---

### tl;dr

- Topic(s):
  - Markdown
  - Interpreter vs. Compiler
  - Repl.it
  - Python 2 vs 3
- Time: 90 minutes

### Today's Topic(s)

Big thing today was learning the Markdown syntax so I can start writing these updates. I haven't really used Markdown extensively before so having this pretty easy to use language is a great way to take notes and make it look great. The other side benefit here is that I can practice reading documentation. These always seems so daunting, I've tried reading CSS library documentation and it was a tough one.

Other than that, we really just covered the basics today in terms of what Python is and at a high level (no pun intended) how Python gets interpreted into machine code and the differences between interpreters and compilers.

Got an introduction to repl.it which just looks like a playground for people to quickly test out their code. And finally, Python 3 that came out in 2008 is still 'newish' and that some code bases are still written in Python 2.

### Journal

I'm going to use this section to documenthow I feel and improvements that I want ot make to this repo. The majority of my inspiration came from my awesome co-worker Connor, so cheers to him and make sure to follow him on Twitter: [@connorrobots](https://twitter.com/connorrobots).

It seems daunting to have to recap everything everyday, but i know this is how I'll grow and I expect these recaps to be shorter in the future.... or maybe even longer who knows!

One thing that might help though is the possibility of using a text expander like Typinator or Alfred to very quickly dish out Markdown syntax like the one to write Python script. I'm going to work on that in Day 2.

# Tools

### Classes

- [Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/) Quick tip, if you haven't been on Udemy before, all of their classes are routinely on sale for \$10, I wouldn't recommend buying full price!

- [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) Same thing, also always on sale for about \$10

### Applications

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my text editor, I'll post my extensions list at a later point

- [Zappy by Zapier](https://zapier.com/zappy) Screenshot capture for MacOS only.

- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) Tbh, I haven't really explored the full functionality of this yet the tabs are cool, but I don't feel advanced enough yet to understand why this is better than the normal MacOS native terminal.
